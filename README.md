# homepage

I created this page to showcase some current projects that I am working on. The purpose of this page is to create a portfolio of work to show off my web development abilities; I will be using this Readme to document my work. unless otherwise noted, all work is my own. 

I began this project on 2/11/21, using HTML5 Boilerplate to get started. (https://html5boilerplate.com/) I am hosting it on Github pages (https://github.com/alexaking/homepage)
    My first goal is to create an interactive menu to point to my projects.
